# Oracle Hub – Architecture

## Overview

The hub is a single Soroban contract (`OracleHubContract`) whose logic is split
into focused modules. Prices are produced by combining one or more per-asset
`PriceFeed` slots, each of which is either **push** (an oracle signs a price)
or **pull** (an external `PriceProvider` contract is queried live). Feed
quotes are filtered for outliers and combined with the asset's effective
aggregation strategy. Health monitoring and emergency freezes gate whether an
asset may serve prices at all.

## Module layout

| Module | Responsibility |
| ------ | -------------- |
| `lib.rs` | Contract entry points, auth, global freeze, orchestration |
| `types.rs` | Data types, constants, events |
| `storage.rs` | `DataKey` layout |
| `feeds.rs` | Per-asset feed index, slot lookups, iteration |
| `interface.rs` | `PriceProvider` trait + generated `PriceProviderClient` |
| `provider.rs` | Pull-based provider fetch, validation, timestamp clamp, decimal rescale |
| `aggregation.rs` | Median, weighted, and trimmed-mean strategies, outlier filtering |
| `fallback.rs` | Deviation-checked selection of the leading source |
| `cache.rs` | TTL price cache, epoch invalidation, counters |
| `health.rs` | Feed classification, failure counters, circuit breaker |
| `upgrade.rs` | Staged/apply upgrade mechanism |
| `tests/` | 10 focused test suites (96 tests) |

## Price production flow

```
report_price (push) ──► PricePoint per (asset, priority)
provider get_price  ──► fetch_provider_price ─► PricePoint per (asset, priority)
                             (pull)

resolve(asset):                              cache::fresh_entry?
    require_not_frozen / asset breaker            └─ hit ─► record_hit, return Cached
    for slot in feed_index(asset)            cache miss
        skip disabled / no point feeds
        jump out stale feeds (auto-disable; event)
        pull feeds: fetch → rescale → PricePoint
        collect FeedQuote
    fallback::select_sources(quotes, band)    leader vs median(others) ≥ 3 quotes
        └─ demoted ──► DeviationRejected + FallbackActivated events
    accepted.len() < min_sources?  ──► revert InsufficientSources
    aggregation::aggregate(accepted, strategy, band)
        reject outliers > band from median
        Median      -> lower median, avg confidence
        Weighted    -> Σ(price*w*conf)/Σ(w*conf)
        TrimmedMean -> drop both tails, average the rest
    recover auto-breaker if healthy
    cache::store(quote, clamped ttl)
    return AggregatedPrice
```

Effective strategy resolution in `get_aggregation_strategy`:
per-asset override (`DataKey::AggregationParams(asset)`) else the hub default
(`DataKey::DefaultStrategy`, initialized to `Median`).

## Storage layout

All keys live in instance storage. `DataKey` variants (see `storage.rs`):

| Key | Type | Purpose |
| --- | ---- | ------- |
| `Governance` | `Address` | Governor (auth for management ops) |
| `Admin` | `Address` | Admin (initialized, reserved) |
| `Version` | `u32` | Protocol version, bumped by upgrade |
| `Frozen` | `bool` | Global freeze flag |
| `DefaultStrategy` | `AggregationStrategy` | Hub-wide default |
| `AggregationParams(Bytes)` | `AggregationParams` | Per-asset strategy, deviation band, source floor |
| `FeedCount` | `u32` | Total registered feed slots |
| `FeedIndex(Bytes)` | `Vec<u32>` | Registered slots of an asset |
| `Feed(Bytes, u32)` | `PriceFeed` | Feed config per (asset, priority) |
| `LatestPrice(Bytes, u32)` | `PricePoint` | Last report / pull per slot |
| `ConsecutiveFailures(Bytes)` | `u32` | Health failure counter |
| `LastSuccess(Bytes)` | `u64` | Last successful read timestamp |
| `AssetBreaker(Bytes)` | `BreakerState` | Per-asset circuit breaker |
| `PriceDecimals` | `u32` | Canonical precision (default 8, max 18) |
| `CacheTtl` | `u64` | Configured cache TTL in seconds (default 0) |
| `CacheEpoch` | `u32` | Bumped by every governance mutation |
| `CacheStats` | `CacheStats` | hits / misses / writes / pull_reads |
| `CachedPrice(Bytes)` | `CachedPrice` | Memoized aggregate, its TTL and epoch |
| `ProposedWasm` | `BytesN<32>` | Staged upgrade hash |

## Pluggable provider interface

```rust
#[contractclient(name = "PriceProviderClient")]
pub trait PriceProvider {
    fn get_price(env: Env, asset: Bytes) -> ProviderPrice;
}
```

`ProviderPrice { price: i128, decimals: u32, timestamp: u64, confidence: u32 }`.

Provider contract expectations (enforced/assumed by `provider.rs`):

- `price > 0`, otherwise the pull reverts (`InvalidPrice`-style assert). A
  failing pull makes the whole `get_price` revert — never serve a wrong price.
- `timestamp` is clamped down to the current ledger time so a future-stamped
  quote can never be treated as fresher than it is.
- read-only; no authorization required from the hub.

`fetch_provider_price(asset, provider)` exposes live pulls to callers.

## Health monitoring

Per-feed classification (`classify_feed`) produces `FeedStatusCode`:

| Status | Condition |
| ------ | --------- |
| `Active` | enabled, not frozen, last point within staleness window |
| `Stale` | enabled, no point or point older than the threshold |
| `Disabled` | feed explicitly disabled by governance or auto-disabled |
| `Frozen` | global freeze or asset breaker open |

Circuit breaker state machine (`health.rs`):

```
get_price succeeds ──(recover_breaker_if_healthy)──► breaker cleared, failures reset
       │
failures: external monitor calls monitor_oracle_health(asset):
       0 ─► 1 ─► 2 ─► 3+ (AUTO_BREAKER_FAILURE_THRESHOLD)
                            └──► open BreakerState{open_until: now+600, auto: true}
                                 └──► is_asset_frozen=true; get_price reverts (Frozen)
                                 └──► after cooldown: reads resume; successful read clears
```

- **Auto breaker** (`auto=true`): opened by the failure counter, self-heals on
  the first successful `get_price` after cooldown.
- **Governance freeze** (`auto=false`): opened by `freeze_asset`, only closed by
  `unfreeze_asset`; never self-heals.
- **Global freeze** (`Frozen=true`): halts all pricing and all mutation;
  `get_price`, `report_price`, `stage_upgrade`, and feed changes revert.

`check_feed_health(asset) -> Vec<FeedStatus>` and
`get_health(asset) -> OracleHealthStatus` are read-only views for off-chain
monitors.

## Aggregation

Runs in three stages, all bounded by `MAX_FEEDS_PER_ASSET` (5):

1. **Selection** (`fallback.rs`) — see below.
2. **Outlier filter**: a quote is kept iff
   `deviation_bps(price, median(quotes)) <= band`. Non-positive prices are
   always dropped. If fewer than two quotes survive, aggregation fails closed:
   an unvalidated single quote must not control the price. A single quote with
   no competitors short-circuits and is returned directly, flagged `Sole`.
3. **Combination**:

- Median: lower median of kept prices (index `(len-1)/2`); confidence = mean of
  kept confidences; timestamp = latest.
- Weighted: effective weight `w = feed.weight_bps * max(confidence, 1)`;
  `price = Σ(price·w) / Σw`; confidence = confidence-weighted mean. Feed
  weight defaults to `10_000` bps.
- TrimmedMean: drops the highest and lowest kept price and averages the rest
  (median for fewer than three kept quotes). Removes one manipulated quote from
  either tail, which a plain mean would absorb.

The reported `deviation_bps` is re-anchored on the surviving set, so consumers
learn how far the sources they actually used disagree.

## Deviation-checked selection

`fallback::select_sources` runs before aggregation and answers one question:
may the leading source be trusted?

- **Quorum.** With fewer than three candidates there is no independent
  reference, so the leader is left alone and aggregation decides.
- **Reference.** The median of every candidate except the leader.
- **Band.** `max_deviation_bps` (default `OUTLIER_DEVIATION_BPS` = 20 %); `0`
  disables the check.
- **Demotion.** Beyond the band the leader is dropped, `DeviationRejectedEvent`
  records `{price, reference, deviation_bps}` and `FallbackActivatedEvent`
  records `{rejected_priority, serving_priority, remaining_sources}`.
- **Fail closed.** If the survivor count would drop below `min_sources` while
  the asset has more than one source, `resolve` reverts with
  `InsufficientSources` instead of publishing a thinner consensus.

Deviation is computed with saturating arithmetic and returns `i128::MAX` for
non-positive operands, so a zero or negative quote can never be counted as
agreeing with the reference.

## Price cache

`cache.rs` memoizes the aggregated price per asset for `min(configured TTL,
shortest source staleness budget)` seconds. Entries carry the configuration
epoch they were produced under, and every governance mutation
(`bump_epoch`) invalidates all of them, so a cached aggregate can never outlive
the configuration it was computed from. `set_cache_ttl` is deliberately not an
invalidating mutation. `refresh_price` bypasses the cache, and
`get_cache_stats` exposes hits, misses, writes, and pull reads.

The cache is off by default (`DEFAULT_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS = 0`): serving a
memoized price is a security decision governance has to make explicitly.

## Upgrade mechanism

```
stage_upgrade(hash) [governance, not frozen] ──► DataKey::ProposedWasm = hash
upgrade()            [governance, not frozen] ──► require staged
    1. remove ProposedWasm
    2. Version += 1
    3. emit UpgradeExecutedEvent(old, new, hash)
    4. env.deployer().update_current_contract_wasm(hash)   // atomic swap
```

Instance storage (all `DataKey` entries above) survives the swap, so upgraded
code must keep a storage-compatible layout. The swap itself is a Soroban VM
operation: it cannot be exercised in the unit-test env (which rejects
`upload_wasm`), so it is validated in integration deployments; unit tests cover
the full governance lifecycle and the VM's rejection of invalid targets.

## Events

All re-exported from `types.rs`: `FeedRegisteredEvent`, `FeedUpdatedEvent`,
`FeedDisabledEvent`, `FeedEnabledEvent`, `FeedAutoDisabledEvent`,
`PriceReportedEvent`, `PricePulledEvent`, `ProviderPriceRescaledEvent`,
`DeviationRejectedEvent`, `FallbackActivatedEvent`,
`PriceCachedEvent`, `CacheConfigUpdatedEvent`, `PriceDecimalsUpdatedEvent`,
`AggregationParamsUpdatedEvent`, `AssetStrategyUpdatedEvent`,
`DefaultStrategyUpdatedEvent`, `FrozenEvent`, `UnfrozenEvent`,
`HealthFailureEvent`, `HealthSuccessEvent`, `BreakerOpenedEvent`,
`BreakerUnfrozenEvent`, `UpgradeStagedEvent`, `UpgradeExecutedEvent`.

## Security model

- All management paths require governance `require_auth`.
- `report_price` authorizes the *registered oracle address* for the slot.
- Pull providers are untrusted inputs: prices are validated (`> 0`),
  timestamps clamped, and decimals normalized before use.
- No source can steer the aggregate by itself: a demoted leader is removed and
  reported, and a read that cannot reach `min_sources` reverting rather than
  publishing a thin consensus.
- Aggregation is bounded by `MAX_FEEDS_PER_ASSET`, so the read cost cannot grow
  with governance configuration; the feed index keeps it proportional to the
  sources actually registered.
- The price cache is opt-in, clamped to source freshness, and invalidated by
  every governance mutation.
- Health failures only auto-freeze the affected asset, never the whole hub.
- A disabled or stale feed never participates in aggregation; a halt returns
  errors rather than a fabricated price.
